## On-campus

### Microscopy part
Follow the instructions on page 18 in the lab manual to make the microscopy slide.  
The assistants will take you to the microscope.

### Plasmid DNA extraction and gel electrophoresis
Follow the instructions on page 22 to pour your agarose gel, and perform the plasmid DNA extraction.  
You can run the gel electrophoresis and check your gel results under the UV-light.  

One you both the fluorescence microscopy images and gel electrophoresis results, try to answer following questions and use it to discuss your findings in the report:
- I see both a plasmid band in the gel, and I have fluorescent bacteria! Yes, conjugation was succesful?  
- I saw fluorescent bacteria with the microscope, but I don't see a plasmid band in the gel? What could have happened?
- I see a plasmid band, but my bacteria were not fluorescent?  
- The plasmid band size is... correct size, not correct size?

### Microscopy part
Read the instructions on page 18 in the lab manual to know how to make the microscopy slide.  
Now you will be able to handle the [virtual fluorescence microscope](https://myscope.training/legacy/confocal/virtual/fluorescence.php) to observe a sample.  
Please follow the instructions given on the webpage to turn the fluorescence on, focus your sample.  You can also try out the module light microscopy, and the module confocal microscopy.

Answer to the following questions:  
- Can you explain the principle of a fluorescence microscope? How does it work?
- Which filters are we going to use to excite the gfp molecule?  
>>>> Write me a mail (sofie.thijs@uhasselt.be) when you are ready with this module.  
You will get from us the fluorescence microscopy images of your bacterium you chose to work with. NOTE: The results of the images will depend on the medium that you have chosen and how sterile you worked (this will get judged based on the images you send me from the conjugation, and quadrant streaking excercise).  

One you have the images, try to interpret them:  
- I see fluorescent bacteria! So my conjugation was succesful?  
- I don't see fluorescent bacteria.. what could have happened?  
- I see that some cells are brighter fluorescent than others? What could have happened?  
- I see different cell shapes than expected, my bacterium is a round cocci and I see rods?  

### Plasmid DNA extraction and gel electrophoresis
Read the instructions on page 22 to know how to pour an agarose gel, and how to perform the plasmid DNA extraction.  
You can virtually load the gel, similar as in lab part 1 using the virtual module. You can practice it again, or go on to the next step.

You will get from us the gel electrophoresis results.   
NOTE: The results of the gel will depend on the bacterium you have chosen to work with, the selective medium you chose etc..  

One you both the fluorescence microscopy images and gel electrophoresis results, try to answer following questions and use it to discuss your findings in the report:
- I see both a plasmid band in the gel, and I have fluorescent bacteria! Yes, conjugation was succesful?  
- I saw fluorescent bacteria with the microscope, but I don't see a plasmid band in the gel? What could have happened?
- I see a plasmid band, but my bacteria were not fluorescent?  
- The plasmid band size is... correct size, not correct size?
