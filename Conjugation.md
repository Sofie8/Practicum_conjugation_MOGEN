## On-campus

Follow the instructions of the assistant to perform the conjugation.

Lunch break

Choose your selective medium to be able to select your transconjugant. Question to help you:  
- Which nutrient medium are you going to use? Hint: you want only your receptor+gfp-vector strain (= transconjugant) to grow, not the donor and helper *E.coli*
- Are you going to add certain supplements to your medium as carbon or nitrogen source?
- Are you going to incubate at a certain temperature?
- Are there other things you are going to do, other ways you know of to select your transconjugant?

Follow the instructions of the assistant to streak plate the bacteria after the conjugation, on your selective medium.

When you have confirmation of the correct medium, you can now streak the bacteria after conjugation, on your selective medium.
Watch the instruction [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYBZxRJLMnY) how to do streak plate method, and then do it yourself using this [virtual lab module](https://learn.chm.msu.edu/vibl/content/streakplate/streak_plate/streak_plate.html).
