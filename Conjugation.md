## On-campus

### Perform the conjugation
Follow the instructions on page 16 in the lab manual, to perform the triparental conjugation.  
The assistants will demonstrate how you work sterile.

Lunch break

### Choose the selective growth medium
Choose your selective medium to be able to select your transconjugant. Questions to help you:  
- Which nutrient medium are you going to use? Hint: you want only your receptor+gfp-vector strain (= transconjugant) to grow, not the donor and helper *E.coli*
- Are you going to add certain supplements to your medium as carbon or nitrogen source?
- Are you going to incubate at a certain temperature?
- Are there other things you are going to do, other ways you know of to select your transconjugant?

### Plate the bacteria on your selective medium
Follow the instructions on page 17 in the lab manual, to streak your bacteria on plate after conjugation.  
The assistants will also show you how to do this.

## Online

### Perform the conjugation
Follow the instructions on page 16 in the lab manual, to know how to perform the triparental conjugation.  
You are going to add all 3 bacteria on top of each other, the bacteria need to make contact, in order for conjugation to happen.

>>>> Mail me the medium for feedback (sofie.thijs@uhasselt.be).

### Plate the bacteria on your selective medium
When you have confirmation of the correct medium, you can now streak the bacteria after conjugation, on your selective medium.
Watch the instruction [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYBZxRJLMnY) how to do streak plate method, and then do it yourself using this [virtual lab module](https://learn.chm.msu.edu/vibl/vibl/StreakPlate/streak_plate_HTML5Canvas.html).

Your bacteria will grow over the weekend! Let's check the results on monday morning together.
