## On-campus

### gDNA extraction
Choose your receptor bacterial strain you will work with during this practicum.   
Perform the gDNA extraction by following the instructions on page 4 of the lab manual.  
Additional instructions are given by the assistant how to operate the pipets and centrifuges.

During the first 30 minute break (incubation step at 37°C):   
- Find a covid-safe spot to work on your laptop and look up what each product does in the process of DNA-extraction.  

During the second 30 minute break (incubation step at 56°C):  
- Find a covid-safe spot to work on your laptop and search the growth characteristics of your receptor strain: where was it found, which growth medium can it use, does it has plasmids?  
Hint: use the [NCBI website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the accession number of your strain to query, given on page 4 of the labmanual.  

Lunch break

### plasmid DNA extraction
Follow the instructions of the assistant to perform the plasmid extraction, on page 11 in the lab manual.  
The procedure is different then the gDNA extraction, how and why?  

### gel electrophoresis
Follow the instructions of the assistant to load your gDNA and plasmid DNA on the gel, on page 13 in the lab manual.  
You will receive the gel results the next day in the morning.

## Online

### gDNA extraction
Choose the receptor bacterial strain you will work with during this practicum.
>>>> Send me a mail with the name of the receptor strain that you will work with (sofie.thijs@uhasselt.be)  

Read the instructions on page 4 of the lab manual to know how to perform the gDNA extraction.  
When you are ready, enter the virtual class.  

Based on the email instructions you should have signed up for [praxilab](https://praxilabs.com/en/sign-up).
Click on the module: DNA extraction, enter the virtual lab, and follow the DNA-extraction protocol that the virtual instructor gives you.  
Click on the robot to let him speak.

After you finish the DNA-extraction, search what each product in the DNA-extraction kit does.  
You have used different products to extract the DNA then your colleagues in the wet lab.  
The products you used are the following, what is the typical composition of the products you used, why, what happens with the DNA in each step?  
- RNAse A  
- Lysis solution  
- Phenol chloroform  
- Chloroform  
- Ethanol (70 % and 90%)  
- TE elution buffer  

How does it differ from the protocol your colleagues used. What are the advantages, disadvantages?  

Lunch break

### Plasmid DNA extraction
Read the instructions how to perform a plasmid DNA extraction on page 11 in the lab manual (there is no virtual module for this).  
The procedure is different then the gDNA extraction, how and why?  

### Gel electrophoresis
Read the instructions how to load your gDNA and plasmid DNA on an agarose gel, on page 13 in the lab manual.  
In praxilab, click on the module: gel electrophoresis, enter the virtual lab, and follow the protocol that the virtual instructor gives.  
What is the role of the red 'stain' that you add to the agarose?  What is the role of the loading buffer?  Why do we orientate the gel and load from - to + ?

You will receive the gel results the next day in the morning.

- If you have time left: check this [video](https://github.com/Sofie8/Practicum_conjugation_MOGEN/blob/main/Thebacterialgenome.mp4) about the bacterial genome organisation.  
Use this to discuss your findings of the DNA extraction results. What is the expected size of the gDNA, what do you see on gel? Are there plasmids?
